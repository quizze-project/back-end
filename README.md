The Java language have been chosen to optimize the process of scaling and make a platform witch can handle with big
requests and keep a good consistency.

# Framework

#### Choice

The framework is **Spring Boot 2.3.4**

We selected Spring because its simplicity of creating new models and migrate them to database. The framework itself
is simpler when compared to other frameworks that run in JVM as Ktor.

The database is **PostgreSQL 12.3**

##### Why we chose this database?

We didn't want to use MySQL because to create new relations without an array of items seen a bit complicated. 
And use a nosql database sounded too simple to this project.
